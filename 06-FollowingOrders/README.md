# Challenge #5: Following Orders

## Overview

In this challenge, you will use the proximity sensors for a different purpose - remote control! Without the IR emitters, the sensors can be used to receive commands from your remote control, allowing you to drive the robot with it.

## Support

If you need assistance with anything (even if you just don't know where to start), **please** contact any of us via Slack publicly or privately. You can also meet with us via Zoom during our "office hours." These hours are listed in a pinned post on Slack.

## Prerequisites

* You must have completed all previous challenges - this challenge builds off what you have previously learned.

* To read commands from the remote control, you need to understand how they are encoded. This remote uses the NEC encoding type. You should read through [this article](https://techdocs.altium.com/display/FPGA/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol), which provides a good overview of how the commands are structured. Note that "Âµs" stands for microseconds (1/1000th of a millisecond).

## Challenge

1. Download "06-FollowingOrders.zip" from GitHub and unzip it to create a new folder. We recommend placing this folder under "Documents." Again, this folder will be your template that you develop from.

2. Open this *folder* in VSCode, then click on "06-FollowingOrders.ino". On Mac, click "Win32" in the lower right corner and change your configuration to "Mac"

3. Lots of other steps that haven't yet been figured out.

**Remember, if you are stuck please ask for assistance on Slack or during office hours.**
