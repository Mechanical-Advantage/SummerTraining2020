## Overview

The previous challenge shows how we can use the Zumo's sensors to our advantage. This challenge will expand on that concept by introducing the proximity sensors, which provide data on the robot's surroundings. Using these sensors, you will create a program that allows the Zumo to navigate complex spaces autonomously.

## Support

If you need assistance with anything (even if you just don't know where to start), **please** contact any of us via Slack publicly or privately. You can also meet with us via Zoom during our "office hours." These hours are listed in a pinned post on Slack.

## Prerequisites

* You must have completed all previous challenges - this challenge builds off what you have previously learned.

* You should read through [this page](https://example.com), which explains how the proximity sensors on the Zumo are positioned and how to interpret the data they produce.

## Challenge

1. Download "03-ComingThrough.zip" from GitHub and unzip it to create a new folder. We recommend placing this folder under "Documents." Again, this folder will be your templates that you develop from.

2. Open this *folder* in VSCode, then click on "03-ComingThrough.ino". On Mac, click "Win32" in the lower right corner and change your configuration to "Mac"
