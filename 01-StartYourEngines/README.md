## Overview

When starting in a new environment, programmers will often create a "Hello world" program - enough to do something interesting but not overly complex. This is the Zumo version of "Hello world." Your challenge is to begin to explore how to interact with the basic functions of the Zumo - motors, buttons, and LEDs, by programming the Zumo to drive along a simple path.

## Prerequisites

* You must have set up your VSCode IDE with Arduino. You can do so by following these instructions for [Mac](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cyeOuGeWGI4tj6PQgyC6Zz0o6Nv5z3nh0UwPVeGp7-I/edit?usp=sharing) or [Windows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y6T2atl-b8Y2t-8qAfPKwe7EO9_AVQGZKfdK217bZew/edit?usp=sharing).

* If you are new to programming or Arduino specifically, we recommend completing [this tutorial](http://www.google.com) as an introduction.
