# Zumo Sumo Rules

* Masks and social distancing will be required at the event and must be observed when placing or removing Zumos from the ring

* The sumo ring is a 30.3" diameter white circle surrounded by a 1' black line. The ring has two starting lines (thinly outlined rectangles, with dimensions 3/8' by 4') near the center of the field. The starting lines are spaced 4' apart.

* Zumo robots will be unmodified and have nothing added except for any creative identifying art applied to the face of the Zumo blade with removable markers by the competitor (being careful not to damage the label).

* Robots must be running autonomously and must use the same countdown length as in the template code from the time a button is pressed (5 seconds when the A button is pressed, 15 seconds for B, 30 seconds for C).

* Matches will be of two types:

    * Ladder competition – Two competitors start with their blades aligned to the inner side of each starting line (facing each other). They compete to be the first to force their opponent out of the ring during a 3 minute match. Multiple matches are played until a robot is forced out of the ring twice. The winner then progresses to the next matchup.

    * Free for all – All competitors start their robots facing inwards wherever they want and the last robot in the ring wins.

* Zumo code may be modified in between matches to take advantage of lessons learned (bring your laptop).

* There will be a judge that calls the match and awards points - the judge's decisions are final.

* As always, gracious professionalism is expected.
